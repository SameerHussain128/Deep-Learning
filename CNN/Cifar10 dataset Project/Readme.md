In this notebook, i will classify small images cifar10 dataset from tensorflow keras datasets. There are total 10 classes as shown below. I will use CNN for classification.

The dataset is inbuild and contains 10 different classes.

classes = ["airplane","automobile","bird","cat","deer","dog","frog","horse","ship","truck"]

Normalize the dataset
I performed both ANN modelling and CNN modelling on dataset
i got 47% accuracy with ANN and 79% accuracy with CNN
The CNN model working and predicting well
